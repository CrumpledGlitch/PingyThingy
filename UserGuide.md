PingyThingy - User Guide
Welcome to PingyThingy! This guide explains how to use the application to monitor your devices.

The Main Dashboard
When you first open index.html, you will see the main dashboard.

System Status Bar: At the top, this bar shows the overall health of your network, displaying the percentage and count of devices that are currently online.

Filters: Use the three dropdown menus to filter the devices shown on screen. You can filter by:

Status: All, Online, or Offline.

Tag: A custom category you've created (e.g., "Projectors").

Room: A physical location you've defined (e.g., "Lecture Hall 1").

Search Bar: Instantly search for a device by typing its name, IP/hostname, or any text in its notes.

Device Grid: This is where all your devices are displayed. The grid is automatically sorted to show offline devices first, so you can immediately see what needs attention.

Managing Devices
Adding a Device: Click the blue + button at the top right to open the "Add New Device" window.

IP/Hostname: The network address that will be pinged.

Friendly Name: A descriptive name for the device.

Tag & Room: Assign the device to a category and location using the dropdowns.

Notes: Add any extra information you need, like serial numbers or MAC addresses.

Editing a Device: Hover over any device card and click the yellow pencil icon. This will open the same window, pre-filled with the device's information for you to change.

Deleting a Device: Hover over a device card and click the red trash can icon.

Device Card Actions
Each device card has several useful features:

Status Indicator: Shows if the device is Online (green, pulsing), Offline (red), or Checking (yellow, spinning).

Duration: Displays how long the device has been in its current state (e.g., "Online for: 2h", "Offline for: 5m").

Connect Button (Smart Button):

Default (Open in Tab): For most devices, this icon looks like a box with an arrow. Clicking it will try to open http://[device_address] in a new browser tab. This is useful for devices with a web interface.

Lectern PC (Download RDP): If a device has the "Lectern PC" tag, the icon changes to a desktop monitor. Clicking it will download a .rdp file for an instant Remote Desktop connection.

Managing Tags and Rooms
Click the gray settings cog icon at the top right.

A new settings panel will appear with a menu on the left.

Click on "Tags" or "Rooms" to view the respective manager.

In each manager, you can:

Type a new name and click "Add" to create a new Tag or Room.

Click the trash can icon next to any existing item to delete it.
